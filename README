SMDA - Squirrel Monkey Digital Atlas
================================================================================

SMDA is a web-based volume viewer to be used with MR, DTI, block, histology,
glyph, and label images.

The volumetric data must be made available to the VM under its /smda directory.
This directory can be configured in app/web_server/smda_web_server.cfg. The
required structure of the volumetric data is described in <another document>.

================================================================================
Installation
================================================================================
To install SMDA onto a VM (tested on CentOS 7), source the build script.

$ source build_env.sh <vm_ip> <vm_ssh_port>

This sets up the environment and enables access to the scripts in the tools
folder. Now copy any ssl certificates and keys to the 'certs' folder under the
project root and edit root/etc/nginx.conf, if necessary. Then enter the password
for the ssl certificate into root/etc/keys/fifo.

Now you can execute the smda-install script.

$ ./smda-install.sh 2>&1 | tee install.log

You may be prompted to enter passwords for the root user and the vuiisdev user
several times. At the end of the install process, the VM will be rebooted and
the web server should be available.

The main code lives under app/web_server and app/web_server/js.
Whenever changes are made to the javascript, they must be compiled and minified
by the Google Closure compiler. You can do this with a Makefile target:

$ make package

You can also just copy all of the javascript files in app/web_server/js to the
root/srv/smda/js folder:

$ make

Then you can copy all of the static files (i.e. js, css, html) files under
root/srv/smda to the VM

$ copystatic

When changes are made to the server python code, you can copy and restart the
server with the following command:

$ copyweb

If you ever need to recopy any configuration files, use this command:

$ copyconfig

To view various logs from your host machine:

$ tailwebserver
$ tailnginx
